        <h3><u>Q1.List out the features of HTML5</u></h3>
        <p>HTML5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that can help you in building modern websites. Here is a set of some of the most prominent features introduced in HTML5.
<ul type="square">
    <li>New Semantic Elements</li>
        <p>These are like < header >, < footer >, and < section >.</p>
    <br>
    <li>Forms 2.0</li>
        <p>Improvements to HTML web forms where new attributes have been introduced for < input > tag.</p>
    <li>Persistent Local Storage</li>
        <p>To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins.</p>
    <li>WebSocket</li>
        <p>A next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web applications.</p>
    <li>Server-Sent Events</li>
        <p>HTML5 introduces events which flow from web server to the web browsers and they are called Server-Sent Events (SSE).</p>
    <li>Canvas</li>
        <p>This supports a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program with JavaScript.
            Audio & Video − You can embed audio or video on your webpages without resorting to third-party plugins.</p>
    <li>Geolocation</li>
        <p>Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web application.</p>
    <li>Microdata</li>
            <p>This lets you create your own vocabularies beyond HTML5 and extend your web pages with custom semantics.</p>
    <li>Drag and drop</li>
            <p>Drag and drop the items from one location to another location on the same webpage.</p>
    </ul>
</p>

        <h3><u>Q2. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities.</u></h3>
        <p>
            An HTML entity is used to display invisible characters and reserved characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code. It is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).
            <p>
                Some characters are reserved in HTML and they have special meaning when used in HTML document. For example, you cannot use the greater than and less than signs or angle brackets within your HTML text because the browser will treat them differently and will try to draw a meaning related to HTML tag.
            </p>
            <h2>Five Commonly used entities are:</h2>
            <table border="5">
                <thead>
                    <th>Symbol</th>

        <h3><u>Q3. What is web accessibility? List some of the assistive devices which play a major role in providing 
            accessibility.</u></h3>
            <p>
                Web accessibility focuses on designing and developing websites that are more accessible to people with disabilities. It means that websites that have applied the accessibility principles can provide more accessible content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Websites have illustrative graphics and images to make the site look appealing or deliver a certain message. In HTML, there is an attribute which displays an alternative text if an image couldn’t be viewed for some reason.This attribute helps with impairments, like visual impairments, which require assistive technologies to consume web content. Some text-to-speech software read the web content if these assistive technologies are used.

                Some people with color blindness may not differentiate normal texts from the clickable links and areas because these elements are similar to each other. The similarity makes differentiating harder for some users.
                
                This problem can be solved in different ways. Underlining the link text can be one way because it differentiates links from normal texts, and makes it easier to recognize the difference. Creating a link button is another option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some impairments may require people to use assistive technologies that make web browsing possible for them. These technologies, like screen readers, assist people with specific tasks that couldn’t be done by themselves.
                <ul type="square">
                    <li><strong>Refreshable Braille display</strong> – a mechanical terminal that displays a line of Braille characters (usually 40-80) by raising and lowering the dots (pins) dynamically. Braille devices with capabilities of small computers incorporate Braille displays. These devices can be used to take notes, calculate numbers, or to interface with other devices such as public information kiosks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen reader</strong> – software that processes content on the desktop and in web browsers, and converts it to others forms such as text-to-speech and Braille. Screen readers typically provide other functions such as shortcut keys, different modes for processing content and interacting with it, and the ability to highlight the text that is being read aloud.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice browser</strong> – similar to screen reader but usually only processes web content. Voice browsers are typically not developed as assistive tools but as alternative web browsers for mobile devices or similar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Volume control </strong>– options to adjust the volume of audio content being played, including options to turn off the sound altogether, that are separate from the overall system settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Screen magnifier</strong> – software used primarily by people with partial sight to enlarge the content to make it easier to see. Some screen magnifiers provide text-to-speech and other functionality.</li>
            
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h3><u>Q4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.</u></h3>
        <p>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li><strong><mark>Semantic HTML</mark></strong>
                    Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the < button> element (and not a < div> element).</li>
                <li><strong><mark>Headings</mark><Strong>Headings are defined with the < h1> to < h6> tags.Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

                    Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections.
                    
                    Screen readers also use headings as a navigational tool. The different types of heading specify the outline of the page.
                <li><strong><mark>Alternative Text</mark><Strong> The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).  
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><u>Q5. Write a short note on the tab index.</u></h3>
        <p>
            The tabindex global attribute allows developers to make HTML elements focusable, allow or prevent them from being sequentially focusable (usually with the Tab key, hence the name) and determine their relative ordering for sequential focus navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It accepts an integer as a value, with different results depending on the integer's value:
            <ul type="square">
                <li>A negative value (the exact negative value doesn't actually matter, usually tabindex="-1") means that the element is not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation.</li>
                <li>tabindex="0" means that the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, after any positive tabindex values. The focus navigation order of these elements is defined by their order in the document source.</li>
                <li>A positive value means the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, with its order defined by the value of the number. That is, tabindex="4" is focused before tabindex="5" and tabindex="0", but after tabindex="3". If multiple elements share the same positive tabindex value, their order relative to each other follows their position in the document source. The maximum value for tabindex is 32767.</li>
                <li>If the tabindex attribute is included with no value set, whether the element is focusable is determined by the user agent.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><u>Q6. List any 5 semantic tags in HTML along with their descriptions.</u></h3>
        <p> 
            <h4>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><mark> < header >:</mark></strong><br>
                    The < header > HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</li>       
                
                <li><strong><mark>< footer >:</mark></strong><br>
                The < footer > HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A < footer > typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.</li>
                <li><strong><mark>< form >:</mark></strong><br>
                    The < form > HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.</li>
                <li><strong><mark>< nav >:</mark></strong><br>The < nav > HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.</li>
                <li><strong><mark>< main >:</mark></strong><br>The < main > HTML element represents the dominant content of the < body > of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</li>
            </ul>

    <div>
        <h3><u>Q7. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our webpage.</u></h3>
        <p>
            In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
        </p>
        <p>Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)</li>
            <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
            <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes</li>
            <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
            <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>
        </ul>
